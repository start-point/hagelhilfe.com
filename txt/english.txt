:: METHOD ::

With the "soft method" for the repairing of hail damage (referred to among experts as "Paintless Dent Repair"), the impact damage caused by the hailstones which are mainly round, is removed by means of diverse lifting and pulling methods without the area concerned having to be repainted. Some of these methods have been recognised in Germany for years and belong to the most common methods for a careful removal of dents up to a diameter of approx. 30 mm and a depth of 5 mm.

The fundamental aspects for appraising the damage are the number and size of the dents. In most cases, the repair is possible environmentally and resources-friendly without it being necessary to replace components and repaint. Whether this method is used however, depends heavily on the experience of the hail technician concerned and whether he continuously concerns himself with the subject.

The advantages of the method at a glance:
• The original paint oat remains intact 
• No paint colour or structure differences
• No time-consuming priming, grinding or tinning
• Low repair costs, shortened repair duration
• The vehicle is not subjected to a value depreciation
• No use of chemicals
• No disposal costs
• No ecological impact
